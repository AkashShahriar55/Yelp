# Summary
The app is setup with Retrofit, a simple search API, and a couple of models with minimal fields.

The app retrieves data from the Yelp API and displays information about restaurants that have pizza and beer . Users can search location on a search bar to get desired restaurants information.

## Getting Started
Replace value of `API_KEY` in `app/build.gradle` with your API Key generated from https://www.yelp.ca/developers/v3/manage_app

There is a simple test included in the `YelpTest.java` class that you may run to verify that your API key is working.
